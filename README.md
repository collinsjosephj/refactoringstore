# |Horiseon Web Services Inc.|
## This project involved using front-end knowledge to refactor the HTML and CSS code to improve web accessibility and search engine optimization. This was an important task, because it not only gives the client more outreach, but also better helps them avoid potential litigation due to unaccessibility. We also employed the Scout Rule, and made semantic changes to the original code, furthering its peformance and giving the client long-lasting functionality and sustainability. Please note: all my code-source whether it be from peers, W3 schools, MDN docs, or instructor help, can be found in comments within my repositories in the html and/or css documents.

## Changes to front-end code
